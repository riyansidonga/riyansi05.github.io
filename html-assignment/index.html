    <p>  
         I am a passionate individual with interests in various fields including design and technology. My journey began in India, where I developed my skills in graphic design and photography. Currently, I am exploring the world of UI/UX design, eager to learn and grow in this exciting field. I believe that creativity is the 1<sup>st</sup> step towards innovation.

         In my free time, I enjoy being active outdoors, taking long bike rides, and spending quality time with <em>family and friends.</em> I believe in the power of creativity to evoke emotions and inspire others. My goal is to create meaningful experiences through design and art.
